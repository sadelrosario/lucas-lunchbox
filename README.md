The game will be about creating a school lunchbox for a kindergarten-aged child named Luca. The player must take different types of food from different food groups each of which will have a different shape similar to those of Tetris blocks. Afterwards, they must fit the food blocks within lunchboxes of varying grid sizes. The player must aim to create a nutritionally-balanced meal with the food blocks they are given. Depending on the nutritional value when the lunchbox is completed, Luca will eat the lunchbox and give the player a different reaction. The goal of the game is to teach the player, presumably a young toddler, the importance of nutritional balance.
